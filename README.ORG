When watching live streams of [[https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc][FIRST Robotics Competition]] events, I
often use [[https://streamlink.github.io/][Streamlink]] to pipe the video into my media player of choice.
I wanted a way to open the streams quickly without ever having to
manually find the link to the stream.
